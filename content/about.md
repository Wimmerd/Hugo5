My name is Wim Christiaens. I was born 25th of June 1972. I am a philosoper and artist living in in Ghent, Belgium. Because my name is common in my region, I sometimes use Wim A. Christiaens. 

Most of the texts on this website will be either in English (my second language) or Dutch (the language I grew up in). It will be clear from the title which language a text is written in.  

I have a philosophy degree from the University of Ghent (1990-1994). I also did a doctorate (1999-2001) and I was a post-doctoral researcher for a while (see [here](https://www.clps.ugent.be/people/members/wim-christiaens)).

For the last ten years or so I was employed as a cleaning worker for [Iris](https://www.iris.be/). Since November 2022 I work for [Stella Maris](https://www.stellamarisgent.be/welcome%20sailors.htm). This gives me time to pursue philosophy, theology, drawing and community (gemeenschap). 

- I continu to do philosophy on a website called [Wim's philosophy blog](https://wimchristiaens.netlify.app/).

- As an artist I am an escapist. My aim is to create a fantasy world. This aspect of my life and other personal stuff will find its way on this website.

- I am a christian in the spirit of Vatican II. This too will figure more on this website.
