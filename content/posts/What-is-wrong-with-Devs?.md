There is something about Devs. I don't know what it is. Something botters me. 
I did not like the main characters: Forest (psychopath) and Lily. 
The character that I liked was Stewart. When he chides Forest for not knowing Bach or Coltrane, for not recognizing a reference to Shakespeare. I like the way he lives: in a trailer. I like his simplicity and his sophisticatino. True, he watches porn; even on what is probably a billion dollar computer: Monroe on top of her then husband Arthur Miller. 

It bothered me that they could watch Jesus suffering on the cross. The image of Joan that starts to scream and wringle as the flames touch her feet. We all know what happened. But I need the distance. I admire both these people. They are founding people of the Western tradition. 

They can be inconsistent because they compartementalize. They are cogs in the machine. They will have their  house, their wife, their children. It will all make sense: fit together. It will work. The meaning is contained in and exhausted by functionality. 

But now are lives are determined by tech people. These are robots. Inconsistent on every level. They have to perspective on the world, on history, on culture. They are drones. Somebody tells them what to do, and they do it. They find release for their agression, for their desire to dominate and rule, in the manner in their code. 
We live in a culture that is torn in two opposite but complementary directions. On the one hand, the 

Stewart is ugly, old and alone. But he is not obsessive. He is ugly on the outside, but not on the inside. Most of the main characters are obsessive, about what they want. They are imperial when it comes to their desire. They are ready to sacrifice the world and everyone in it, for their famility, their relationship. 

That is no different than so many men and women that I have known, who did sacrifice the whole world for a relationship. When it was over, I asked them about their former partner. Who? What do you mean: who? The guy/girl you (virtually) sacrificed everything and everybody for, that is who! 

I understand Forrest up to a point. I understand that he lost his mind. Very much so. 
But I also understand Jesus and Joan. Even more. Not the physical suffering. The spectacular stuff. I understand how they were preoccupied with the world, with culture as a whole. A cause. 

I have been there. I know all about it. I sacrified so much for a woman once. I was obsessive about her. I don't regret it. Or maybe I do. There is no way I am ever doing that again. Mayby that is why Forrest annoys me. 

Forrest explains during one of the episodes that 'Devs' can also be read as 'Deus', the Latin word for God. Humanism at its worst. Man that makes himself into the centre of the universe. 

I don't think Stewart is a christian. But he does have respect, he feels deference. During the last episode he tries to instill some of that into Forrest. But the latter is only interested in restores the past, his past. He only wants to reset the world to a moment before the tragedy he feels responsible took place.
