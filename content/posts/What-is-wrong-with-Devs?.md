There is something about Devs. I don't know what it is. Something botters me. 
I did not like the main characters: Forest (psychopath) and Lily. 
The character that I liked was Stewart. When he chides Forest for not knowing Bach or Coltrane, for not recognizing a reference to Shakespeare. I like the way he lives: in a trailer. I like his simplicity and his sophisticatino. True, he watches porn. Even on what is probably a billion dollar computer: Monroe on top of her then husband Arthur Miller. 
But it bothered me that they could watch Jesus suffering on the cross. The image of Joan that starts to scream and wringle as the flames touch her feet. We all know what happened. But I need the distance. I admire both these people. They are founding people of the Western tradition. They can be inconsistent because they compartementalize. They are cogs in the machine. They will have their  house, their wife, their children. It will all make sense: fit together. It will work. The meaning is contained in and exhausted by functionality. 

But now are lives are determined by tech people. These are robots. Inconsistent on every level. They have to perspective on the world, on history, on culture. They are drones. Somebody tells them what to do, and they do it. They find release for their agression, for their desire to dominate and rule, in the manner in their code. 
We live in a culture that is torn in two opposite but complementary directions. On the one hand, the 
Stewart is ugly, old and alone. He has his job, high culture (Bach, Coltrane, Shakespeare ...) and (probably) porn. He is friends with his teenage colleague. 
But the others: they are obsessive about their desires. They are imperial. They are gods. Or even the one God - when it comes to their desire. They are ready to sacrifice the world and everyone in it, for their little desire. 
Like Neo in the Matrix Reloaded, who sacrificed millions of people to save his girlfriend. 
I do not understand. I have known men and women who did sacrifice the whole world for a relationship. When the relationship was over, I asked them about their former partner. Who? What do you mean: who? The guy/girl you (virtually) sacrificed everything and everybody for, that is who! 
I understand Forrest up to a point. I understand that he lost his mind. Very much so. 
But I also understand Jesus and Joan. Even more. Not the physical suffering. The spectacular stuff. I understand how they were preoccupied with the world, with culture as a whole. A cause. 
I have been there: the obsession with a woman. I sacrified so much for her. I cannot imagine doing that again. That is mayby why Forrest annoys me. Why his new girlfriend annoys (I used to be her). Katie was it? 
Devs is actually the latin word for God. That is where I revolt. Fundamentally. So you can call me a fundamentalist. There is only one God and that is God. Jesus was God. And that was a unique event.
