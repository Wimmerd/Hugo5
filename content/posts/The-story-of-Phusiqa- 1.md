<center> Part of my drawings are illustrations of a story, a fairy tale actually. One that I made up. Section 1 goes like this. </center>

A long time a ago, when reality was still spirit instead of matter, our physical reality as we know it today did not exist. It still had to be created. 

A selection of spiritual creatures (let's call them t-angels) were assigned the task: create Euclidean space, linear time, space-time, the laws of momentum and energy, the laws of chemistry, DNA ... In short, bring about the key structures of our present physical reality; the ones thanks to which light moves on world lines, the right-hand rule lies behind both the behaviour of cork screws and electromagnetic fields, water always boils at the same temperature. 

The t-angels harvested and mined the ingredients they needed. They used an assortment of different forges and cauldrons for different stages, where in each stage, similar actions took place: first, combine the ingredients, then mould the resulting Matter, finally transfigure the Matter. Think of the Matter as a sheet of paper that gets crumpled into a wad. The folds of the wad were deliberate and meaningful. T-angels carved and soldered within them. Each stage had a level of contraction of the wad. 

There were many stages. Our story begins during the second, when a topology and some lattice structures (those were the ingredients), had to be further elaborated moulded and transfigured. Eventually, in some later stage still, the topology would become what we now know and experience as space: by coordinatizing the neighourhouds, constructing affine connections between the neighourhouds, and so on; similarly, the lattices still needed quite a lot of work before some of them would be boolean. It sounds complicated, and so it was. Indeed, t-angels were powerful creative forces, single-minded and meticulous. Their dedicated nature might explain why something went terribly wrong. 

One t-angel got so caught up in her work, that she did not notice the sign which indicated that this stage of work was finished. She worked closely within the Matter, in the folds of it; while the Matter was in its proper cauldron, the one that allowed its folded form (the wad) to contract to the correct degree for t-angels to perform their labor. When the wad was finally taken out of the cauldron, [Phusiqa](https://wimchristiaenszelf.netlify.app/portfolio/phusiqa.jpg) (that is the name of our t-angel) got [caught](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0L2NNFIH7A/), because it contracted to a degree required for the next phase. 

Not until much much later (for what seemed like an eternity) was the Matter decontracted again to the level of phase two.
