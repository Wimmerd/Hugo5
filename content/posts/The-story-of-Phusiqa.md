A selection of spiritual creatures (let's call them angels) were assigned the task to create Euclidean space, linear time, space-time, the laws of momentum and energy, the laws of chemistry, DNA ... - in short: the basic structures of physical reality. 

These angels were spiritual beings in a spiritual environment. There was a minen, where they found the appropriate stuff. They had a cauldron in which they moulded the stuff. The work took place in several stages. In each stage an amount of spiritual material was extracted from a mine and put into a cauldron. After the work on the material was done, it was taken out of the cauldron, and left to itself. 

In the first stage an amount of spiritual matter was moulded a first time. It was made into a topological space. During the second stage, trajectories were introduced through neighourhouds. Then, during the third stage, the different neighourhourds were made into three-dimensionale reference frames. A fourth phase was needed, to coordinate the directions in different reference frames with each other. 

It sounds complicated. The angels had to be powerful creative forces.   

After the work of each stage was finished the spiritual matter that one was moulding, was
