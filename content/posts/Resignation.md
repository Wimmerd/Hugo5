What if my original flesh taught me to\
hand in my resignation to the bourgeois\
women that haunt me, with their expectations\
and make-overs, how I do want to look at a woman, make\
her see me: give me your eyes, make me yours,\
flesh of your flesh, I am Emily, I do not perform -\
insecure and tentatively - for your distress,\
attention or condecension.
